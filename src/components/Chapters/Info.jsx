                      In IEEE RAS INSAT SBC, we aim to share our knowledge and
                      expertise with our members. Our goal is to create a
                      cohesive community fond of robotics that can share its
                      proficiency and leave its footprint in this field. This
                      was my childhood dream and by joining IEEE RAS INSAT SBC,
                      I knew from the first days that I was in the right place
                      and took my first steps to make my dream come true. When
                      joining the IEEE RAS chapter, you will have the
                      opportunity to practice your technical skills and
                      implement your ideas into real projects.

                    <p>
                      Founded in October 2014, the IAS INSAT student chapter was
                      conceived from the belief of a group of students in the
                      importance of putting their theoretical knowledge into
                      practice at an early stage of their education to develop
                      skills enabling them to become potential leaders and to
                      have a prosperous career path. Counting more than 180
                      active members, it is one of the most active chapters in
                      our student branch.

                      The IEEE Tunisia chapter of Power & energy was established
                      in August 2011. In 2016, the INSAT Student Chapter was
                      established as the third PES chapter in Tunisia Section.
                      The INSAT PES chapter is the largest student R8 PES
                      chapter with around 150 IEEE INSAT SB members that hail
                      from different academic backgrounds. The IEEE INSAT PES
                      chapter presents incredible opportunities for the members.
                      The power and energy domain is an unlimited source of
                      knowledge and our chapter is a place where all those
                      interested could exchange the knowledge they have creating

                      IEEE NPSS INSAT Student chapter aims to give its members
                      an opportunity to engage in activities and projects
                      revolving around nuclear and plasma sciences and their
                      multiple applications, as well as discover multiple ways
                      in which their university studies can be implemented in
                      said fields. In order to achieve this purpose, we opted
                      for an activity program that teaches the basics of nuclear
                      and plasma sciences and demonstrates their importance,
